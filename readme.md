Welcome to a full css animation and a little bit js 😀

I wanted to represent a polaroid that could be used through animation and other means. This means that all buttons you will find are functional.

You can click on the button at the top left of the polaroid to launch the device rotation animation and allow the site to activate the webcam to use it for the rest.

When the polaroid has finished its rotation you arrive in front of the viewfinder place yourself right in front of the webcam and click on the button to take the picture 📷

After clicking, the polaroid will rotate one last time to print the picture.
You can also download it by clicking on the download button.

I minified files to optimize the weight of the site.

Thank you 😉
